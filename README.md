Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC)
a MOOC website similar to Coursera. MOOC is simply
described as a website where a user can create a course with multiple lectures; and other users can
view this course and its lectures. 
Scenarios:

As a user, I can register with these attributes: name, email, password, date of birth, gender,profile picture.  
As a user, I can login using email and password.  
As a user, I can create a course with these attributes: title.  
As a user, I can create a lecture that belongs to a course. Lecture will have these attributes:content and attachment (uploaded file).  
As a user, I can comment on a lecture.  
As a user, I can like a lecture.  
As an admin, I can CRUD user, course and lecture models.  

As a user, I can act as an instructor or a regular user. User can create a course or lecture,
only if he acts as an instructor.  
As a user, I can edit and view the content of the lecture as rich text.  

Project includes one test case for model(user model) and one test case for controller (courses controller)
